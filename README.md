## Assessment details

- Read the Marking Criteria for this Project on iQualify.

## Background

We are a small start up mobile app development company. We have recently released a TO-DO app to the Play Store. Our CEO thought it was a great success and would like to improve it with reminder capabilities and biometric authentication.

The app was done by a previous developer who has left the company. The quality of the code is a mixed bag so as a team you will need to figure things out. There are bugs that need to be fixed, code that needs to be improved, and UI that needs improving as well.

In addition to these improvements you will also need to add some new features.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the code and run the app and look for bugs.
2. Familiarize yourself with the code. Find places of bad practise that can be improved.
3. Create a project from GitHub Classroom.
4. Schedule a design studio session on Miro.
5. Create bug tickets, code refactor tickets, and new feature tickets based on the requirements from CEO.
